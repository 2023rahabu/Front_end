Learning Css
# 1. Inline CSS: 
CSS rules are applied directly to individual HTML elements using the style attribute.
<p style="color: blue;"> This is a blue paragraph. </p>
# Internal CSS: 
CSS rules are placed within a <style> element in the HTML document's <head> section.

# 3.	External CSS: CSS rules are stored in a separate .css file and linked to the HTML document using the <link> element.
